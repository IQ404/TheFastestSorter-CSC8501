# The Fastest Sorter - CSC8501

Those are some sorting algorithms I wrote for one of the challenges given in the course *CSC8501: Advanced Programming for Games* as a part of the *Computer Game Engineering MSc* provided by Newcastle University.

The challenge goes as follows:

- The values of the numbers are limited to 1 - 100. The integer array is 1000 elements long. Write the simplest, fastest, sorting algorithm you can to sort these numbers in ascending order.
